Minutemailer API BETA
======================
These instructions are specifically for PHP. We'll add more general instructions soon in order to use the Minutemailer API.

Any questions or comments? Maybe youâ€™re interested in trying out the Minutemailer API? Contact us at <hello@minutemailer.com> and we'll get back to you.

Installation
------------
`$ composer require minutemailer/api`
or download the php-file [Minutemailer.php](https://github.com/minutemailer/api/blob/master/src/Minutemailer/Minutemailer.php) if you are not using composer.

Usage
-----
Make sure the file is loaded, either by `require 'vendor/autoload.php'` if you are using composer or `require 'path/Minutemailer.php'` if you are not.

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

$clientId = 'ThisIsMyId';
$clientSecret = '123456789asdf';
$client = new Minutemailer\Minutemailer($clientId, $clientSecret);

// Data required
$contactListToken = 'asdf123';
$postData = [
  'name'  => 'Firstname Lastname',
  'email' => 'validemail@domain.com'
];

$response = $client->subscribe($contactListToken)->post($postData);
```

Please note that both name and email are required. `$response` will be filled with the contact data if the request is valid. Otherwise, an error will be returned.
